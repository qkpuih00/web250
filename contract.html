        <p>I, <a href="https://students.cpcc.edu/~qkpuih00/web250/introduction.html">Quyen Kpuih</a> agree to abide by the 
            terms in my Spring 2021 WEB250-N890 Advanced 
            Web Markup & Scripting with my instructor, 
            DI von Briesen.</p>
        <p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there 
            that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
        <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, 
            failure to turn in assignments may show as an absences.</p>
